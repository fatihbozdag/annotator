There is rarely a moment of silence in the course of a conversation between Italians, we are rather uncomfortable with silence. It's not unusual for us speak loudly and animated, but we are quite eloquent at least! Non-verbal communication is extremely important in Italy, and it is quite normal for us to use ones hands in conversation. I have to admit that Italians have very little concept of personal space and tend to stand quite close when talking. We probably are known for using more physical contact than most other Europeans during conversation. Italian's initial introductions are usually formal, even in a friendly situation. The handshake is the common form of greeting. Italians prefer to be introduced by a third party rather than introducing themselves. If you are in a group of many people it is easily expected to shake hands with everyone in that group. Once a relationship is formed, friends and acquaintances may give a kiss on both cheeks in greeting. The most important thing i can suggest to you is about the eye contact which should be direct and constant.

In this way, you could reduce your coffee expenses more than %50. My another advice is about lunch. trying to endure walking more, you might find new restaurants which are cheaper in the neighborhood of your office, instead of buying things at the shop you told. This may also give the chance of avoiding old unhealthy and expensive foods. finally, due to your budget constraint again, you and your friends should choose the way of cooking the dinner and drinking at home. You may find it difficult to do at first, but you would be able to cooking nicer dinner at home in time. Also this way helps you expense less on drinks.

I think you should do your meals by yourself at home, instead of eating outside. You could go to the supermarket on the weekends and buy all the ingredients you need. Thus, you would not have problems to prepare your breakfast in the morning before going to work. Besides, you could cook your own lunch, put it into the freezer and take it to your office in working days. instead of having dinner out, you'd better invite your friends home or try another group activity with them, maybe running or cycling.

For lunch, you can make a deal with a snack bar, ask for a discount and to pay in the end of the month, however every now and then you can pack a sandwich, but it is important to estimate the costs, depending on the ingredients used, you can spend more money packing a lunch, than buying it done. It is very important to keep your social life, you could invite some friends to dinner at your house, they can bring some food and you all share the costs, it will be fun and no one will spend a lot. sometimes saving money can be tough, but in the future you will see the benefits.

I want to share a story with you about the groom. Some of people here might have heard this story before, but it still deserves repeating. The first day my daughter took him to our family to have a dinner, they insisted that they were just friends. I guess that they were too shy to speak to us directly, then I present that I was angry of seeing my daughter dating someone at her age of 18. The groom couldn't hold on so long but admit their relationship and ask us to allow them to continue to meet each other. I liked his honest personalities at the first glance.

If you carefully look the picture, you can see that the woman seems to be Marylin Monroe. Any woman wants to look glamorous as Marylin Monroe and, a Century watch, certainly makes you feel glamorous as her. Any man wants to draw attention to a woman like Marylin Monroe and, a Century watch surely makes you feel elegant, ready to catch a woman. So, the key world is GLAMOUR.

You don't have to think that life is simple, but you know, it must be very harsh and you need to learn all the ways which can direct you towards the correct life's path.

In contrast, up to 47% of the 18- to 24-year-old men purchase one magazine a month. 69% of the first demographic group prefer magazines to blogs, on the other hand, 72% of the second demographic group prefer magazine supported by extensive website content.

In comparison the group 2 that our store has 2 competitive products the group 1 already has 6 competitive products. The purchase power for the group 2 is stronger than the group 1, on the other hands the demographic size for the group 2 is smaller than the group 1, while the group 1 will be achieve in 2025 around 30 million women the group 2 will be achieve 20 million men, but both groups will have a lot of money to expend in 2025 projection.",133441

404325,C1,"Dear Sir, I've got proposals from Mrs. Hamilton c/o loss advertising for our advertising campaign and I really think the best picture and the most appropriate slogan is ""wolf and Century, the perfect team."" reasons: We know that our product was associated with people who are modern, a bit snobbish and first of all who likes to live in a exclusive environment. I guess that many people have idols like successful manager and the more successful people being the more they tend to sports like golf, sailing or gliding. However, we have to look that our ""Century"" is a part of this luxurious, successful lifestyle. Having a glimpse to the picture on a big billboard people see the relaxed posture from the man wearing a ""Century"" on his wrist, playing golf, the weather is fine and he is satisficed by a good hit.

402866,C1,"First of all it's necessary to emphasise that the second demographic group possesses purchasing power almost twice greater than the first one. Though this group is estimated to shrink a bit by 2025, we should pay much attention to developing products that can become strong competitors to the recent ones. In addition, it's very popular nowadays to use QR code. And the research shows that 72% of young men prefer magazines supported by extensive website content. It goes without saying that we'd better look in the future and also pay attention to the first demographic group. 15- to 19-year-old women provide the annual turnover about $153 billion and it's estimated to grow up to $175 billion by 2025. Though 69% of the group prefer magazines to blogs we still have the rest 31%. As for the demographic size, this group is estimated to grow by 25% to 30 million in 2025. To summarize the report, I can say that expanding into each of the two markets has its pros and cons and we have to think thoroughly before making the final decision.",81913
405556,C1,"Dear all, Here are a few tips about business etiquette in Russia. In general, local business etiquette is not unique and close to international however you should observe some points: - Make business appointments well in advance and don't be late. It's perceived insulting if someone is late even for 5-10 min. - If you are invited to someone's home, take a small gift. Some candies or a bottle of wine will do. If you're going to visit close friends it's ok to bring more precious gift. - Modern Russians adore geopolitics therefore political discussions are welcome. Of course you should not put this discussion on top of the agenda, it's more polite to start with more neutral topics like weather. - It's a myth that Russians are always open-minded. Don't try to behave in a buddy-buddy way unless you know your partner well (or at least you had a couple with him last night). - Service charges are basically not included in the bill so it's up to you to show your satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the service.",55284

First of all I'd like you to know that if you're willing to change your spending habits you'll do it and, besides, you're not going to miss that time when you used to spend a lot because it was unhealthy physical and psychologically. firstly, I'd recommend you to develop your abilities on kitchen, as far as I'm concerned, food is the most critical point at concerning your expenses, so, you could, instead of buying a double latte coffee on you way to work, to get up a little bit earlier and make your own coffee or, even, have breakfast at home. secondly, I have to tell you that eating junk food is even more harmful to your healthy than having a cup off coffee every morning. I'm sure you could prepare your meal every night when you get home after work, if you get used to it, cooking is not going to be complicated anymore. furthermore, you would feed yourself much better. thirdly, nevertheless, friends can make pressure on you to still going out and spending a lot on expensive dinners and drinks, you have to get over it.

402644,C1,"First of all, we have to take into account that the women's magazines market, in terms of offer, is perhaps natured, as we can see in statistics. That market already has six competitors, which makes our entry much more difficult and expensive. On the other hand, the men's market is still growing, with only three competitors appearing in the next three to five years. In that case, we can enter this market without too many marketing costs. Besides, a market with few companies is prone to be less competitive, which makes its prices more elevated, consequently improving the investment rentability. In contrast, the women's market demands a fair amount of expenditures to become a relevant competitor. If we chose to enter the women's market, I suggest we buy any of the established companies. Still, we need to have in mind that the better acceptance of new technologies from men makes it easier to develop a entirely electronic magazine.",1419

I live only two blocks from the place which was selected for the construction. Although the store is expected to provide a parking car for 300 cars, my real concern is about the traffic congestion which this facility may generate on our main street. It is well known that we already are experiencing some traffic jams on main street this year. I am particular worried if, once the store is opened, those traffic congestion will become a huge problem for our city. Thus, I really think you should reconsider the place for this super-Mart store. In my opinion, there is a closed beer factory in the north suburb which is a much better place to built this facility. The factory is nearby a subway line and is only 3 blocks from the north road. I only ask that you at least think about my idea before approving the store construction. Best regards, Andre",22362

Men are more likely to buy magazines, 47% purchase at least one per month, while just 29% of women buy magazines per month. To meet the expectation of men, we have to offer more services, most men prefer to buy magazines with additional website content, in the other hand most women prefer read a magazine than a blog, so it will cost less and require less effort to sell to women. However the competition is to intense in group one, six products compete and in group two, three competitors.

The nature today is drastically changing, so I think forests will face an uncertain future. We need to change our style of life to preserve the balance of our system.

YU55, the last near-Earth asteroid was discovered at a distance of 324,600 km in November 2011. Its pace was 50,000 km/h. An asteroid of this size could annihilate a whole country. At that time we were lucky, but experts say that a collision with any other asteroid or meteorite is just a matter of time. In my opinion, the third picture concerns our unsustainable lifestyle. There is too much environmental pollution and using up of our planet's natural resources.

In contrast, the TOEFL is more often used by universities to screen students for scholarships or as a placement test. It is used as a measurement for readiness for academic programs . As I apply for a government sponsorship, I think it would be much more suitable to do the TOEFL test. They both test the skills of listening, reading, speaking and writing.

It would be great if we could expand our list and add the vulnerable species group. I think our cards are the way to educate youth, and such information will be very helpful. Another idea concerns the way people could use this cards. I think the best way to learn something is to play games about it.

There are two main reasons for my opinion. firstly, the image and slogan is orthodox and the image is commonly seen by any adults who have played golf. secondly, the image does not show faces of people in detail, but just two guys, and one of them shows his back. I mean that this picture does not specify any particular personal characteristics but it shows classic and stylish image. I think this picture is acceptable for golf players at any level and moreover for any adult. The other two pictures are not bad, but these shows a specific character each. If the image is not acceptable for some people, they surely have bad images on Century. therefore, I believe that the third one is the best. Best regards, joshi Honda",29329
